# Platformer demo using GameJs #

This is a simple platformer game demo I put up to try GameJs features.
To those interested, [GameJs](http://gamejs.org/) is a javascript game library heavily inspired by [pygame](http://pygame.org/).

#### GameJs static
As it is a quite simple demo, I decided to use the _static_ version of the library, thus 'yabbler.js' and the whole GameJs library are included.
